Project Title: Who Takes Home the Gold: Analysis of Historical Olympic Data


Team Members:
Victoria Shirk, Jaewon Jeong, Pamela Mukuyu, Kyle Chou


Project Description Outline:
Our group is trying to analyze how demographics impact olympic results using the Olympic Historical Dataset (1896-2020).


Research Questions To Answer:
Q1: For swimming, how does height/ weight affect the results?
Q2: Which country has the most male medalists and which country has the most female medalists?
Q3: What country has improved the most over time; What country has decreased the most
Q4: Home field advantage?


Datasets to be Used:
Olympic Historical Dataset (1896-2020)


Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
Victoria: Q4
Jaewon: Q2
Pamela: Q3
Kyle: Q1

Q1 Kyle: From the scatter plot, there is no real correlation between BMI, height, or weight vs chances of winning a medal.  Only trend observed is the slope of weight vs height square line tend to increase from Bronze to Gold, but fundamentally the line represent the 22 average BMI between all medalist.  The p value of BMI and weight between different medalist are at 70% to 80%.  The p value are too high to indicate relationships.  The p value for height is the closest to the 5% mark, at 10%.  The count of medals by height ranges were plotted, but the bar charts are virtually identical.
